Octopus Wonderland - CSS Styling Assignment
---

**Objective**:

Your task is to take an existing HTML file, `index.html`, which is a basic webpage about octopuses, and style it using CSS. You are provided with a screenshot, `screenshot.png`, which shows what the finished product should look like. Your job is to make your website look as close to the screenshot as possible using external, internal, and/or inline CSS styles.

**Requirements**:

1. **Match the Screenshot**: Your primary goal is to make your website look like the provided `screenshot.png`. Use your judgement and creativity where the screenshot might be ambiguous.

2. **CSS Types**: Use any or all of the three types of CSS - external, internal, and inline styles - to achieve the desired look.
    - External CSS should be in a file named `styles.css`.
    - Internal CSS should be placed in the `<head>` section of `index.html`.
    - Inline CSS should be directly in the HTML tags where necessary.

3. **CSS Features**: Your CSS can cover a broad range of features.
    - Selectors, properties, and values
    - Elements, IDs, and classes
    - Text and background styling (`color`, `font-size`, `background-color`, etc.)
    - Typography (`font-family`, `font-weight`, `font-style`)
    - Text layout (`text-align`, `line-height`, `text-transform`)
    - CSS box model (`padding`, `border`, `margin`, `content-box`, `border-box`)

4. **Code Comments**: Comment your CSS and HTML code to explain your logic, how you achieved the look to match the screenshot, and any difficulties you encountered.

5. **Maintain HTML Structure**: You can add `class` and `id` attributes to the HTML, but the basic HTML structure (tags and their nesting) must remain the same.

**Submission Instructions**:

- Include the updated `index.html` and `styles.css` files in your git repository.

**Assessment**:

1. Your submitted code will be reviewed for how closely it matches the screenshot, the variety and appropriateness of CSS techniques used, and alignment with the assignment requirements.

2. You may be called upon to explain your code and the decisions you made in styling the webpage to look like the screenshot.
